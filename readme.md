## Git tutorial

1. Initialize git repository with `git init`

2. Stage your files with `git add <filename>` or `git add .`

3. Commit your files with `git commit -m "<your message>"` - (After you commit, the stage is cleared - you have to use git add again to re-stage files.)

4. To create a branch, type `git branch <branch_name>`

5. To check out your branch type `git checkout <branch_name>`
