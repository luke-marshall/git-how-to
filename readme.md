## Git tutorial

2. Stage your files with `git add <filename>` or `git add .`

3. Commit your files with `git commit -m "<your message>"` - (After you commit, the stage is cleared - you have to use git add again to re-stage files.)

4. To create a branch, type `git branch <branch_name>`

5. To check out your branch type `git checkout <branch_name>`

Reminder: To check status, type `git status`

6. To merge branches, go to the branch you want to merge into, and type `git merge <branch_name>`

7. To add a remote place to push your git code, type `git remote add origin <your_url>`

8. To actually push your code to the cloud, type `git push -u origin master` - afte the first time you can usually just go with `git push`

9. To clone a repository that exists somewhere else, type `git clone <repository_url>`
